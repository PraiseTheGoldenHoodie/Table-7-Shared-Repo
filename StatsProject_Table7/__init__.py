"""
This project takes in your data (whether you want to manually input it or upload it from a file) using one or two columns.
Using those numbers, the options amongst the menus will allow you to run statistical analyses, print graphs, and save the file
using a new username. Until commanded to stop, the file will continue to run, enternally availible to do your bidding. Eventually,
you will grow weary of weilding such power in the form of this Statistics Project program. At that point, you may opt to quit out,
leaving all the data behind without a trace, or saving the data into a file.
