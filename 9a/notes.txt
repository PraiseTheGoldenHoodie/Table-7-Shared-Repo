# to create a stream object:
open(path, mode)
# path
# example of relative path (use this if file in same folder as python file):
open(r"myFile.txt")
#example of absolute path (use this if file is elsewhere):
open(r"C:\Users\you\Projects\PythonProjects\Table-7-Shared-Repo\7a\myOtherFile.txt")
# mode
open(path, "r")  # read only
open(path, "w")  # write only
open(path, "a")  # append
open(path, "r+")  # read-write
# we can add 'b' to specify binary, e.g.
open(path, "rb")
open(path, "ab") 
#etc.

# more common, safer, better way:
with fileName as open(...):
    doStuffToFile

# the other manual, unsafe way:
fileName = open(...)  # creates a stream object
doStuffToFile
fileName.close()  # always close a file whenever you aren't reading it.

#stream methods
stream.readline() # returns iterable of strings
stream.read() # returns single string
stream.readlines() # returns list of strings
list(stream) # same as before
